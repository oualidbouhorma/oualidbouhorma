# Oualid Bouhorma

DevOps enthusiasts seeking to learn about everything related to Linux, CLoud, Kubernetes, Docker and more. Giving some fuel and love to my new passion.

Keep updated about my progress in my [personal website](https://www.oualidbouhorma.com) and follow me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oualidbo/) and my [X](https://x.com/oualidbouhorma) accounts for more!

## Who am I?

I’m Oualid Bouhorma, a Computer Engineering student documenting what I learn as I work my way into DevOps: Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and more.

My goal is to build strong fundamentals and the problem-solving instincts to thrive in fast-moving environments, minimizing blast radius, maximizing reliability. In short: I’m training to be an “expert problem solver”.

## What am I learning?

At the current moment I'm diving into Linux and all the basics related to it with the objective to fully understand it.

Also, I'm focusing to achieve the AZ-900 Certificate and define the fundamentals of Cloud.

## How am I learning?

The roadmap I’m following is inspired by KubeCraft (from Mischa van den Burg). I’m focusing on solid foundations in: Linux, Python, Go, Containers, Git, and Kubernetes… with an extra serving of Kubernetes (and then a bit more Kubernetes). As a complementary resource I'm also using KodeKloud to achieve the basics and the certifications that I'd love to have.

I’m also building a HomeLab on a laptop to get hands-on with real setups. In my personal [Blog](https://www.oualidbouhorma.com) I’ll share what I’m running, what breaks, and what I add over time, as well as my notes and all the thoughts related to my passion.

## Things I've Built or I'm Building

In order to get started into the foundations of the IT world, focusing on DevOps as well, I'm handling the following projects at this moment:
1. Microsoft Entra ID (Azure) - Corporate Identity and Access Management (IAM)
2. IT Service Desk Implementation - Enterprise Ticketing Lifecycle (osTicket)
3. IT Technical Documentation at my [Blog](https://www.oualidbouhorma.com)
4. IT Operations Automation - Systems Administration Scripts (Bash and Powershell)
5. Network Infrastructure Simulation - Corporate LAN/WLAN Design

All of the repositories related to each one of the projects are here, in GitHub!
