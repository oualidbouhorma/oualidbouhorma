# Oualid Bouhorma

DevOps enthusiasts seeking to learn about everything related to Linux, CLoud, Kubernetes, Docker and more. Giving some fuel and love to my new passion.

Keep updated about my progress in my [personal website](https://www.oualidbouhorma.com) and follow me on my social media accounts for more!

## Ho am I?

I‚Äôm Oualid Bouhorma, a Computer Engineering student documenting what I learn as I work my way into DevOps: Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and more.

My goal is to build strong fundamentals and the problem-solving instincts to thrive in fast-moving environments, minimizing blast radius, maximizing reliability. In short: I‚Äôm training to be an ‚Äúexpert problem solver‚Äù.

## How am I learning?

The roadmap I‚Äôm following is inspired by KubeCraft (from Mischa van den Burg). I‚Äôm focusing on solid foundations in: Linux, Python, Go, Containers, Git, and Kubernetes‚Ä¶ with an extra serving of Kubernetes (and then a bit more Kubernetes).

I‚Äôm also building a HomeLab on a laptop to get hands-on with real setups. In my personal Blog I‚Äôll share what I‚Äôm running, what breaks, and what I add over time.
