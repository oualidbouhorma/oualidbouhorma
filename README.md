# Oualid Bouhorma

DevOps enthusiasts seeking to learn about everything related to Linux, CLoud, Kubernetes, Docker and more. Giving some fuel and love to my new passion.

Keep updated about my progress in my [personal website](https://www.oualidbouhorma.com) and follow me on my social media accounts for more!

## Ho am I?

I’m Oualid Bouhorma, a Computer Engineering student documenting what I learn as I work my way into DevOps: Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and more.

My goal is to build strong fundamentals and the problem-solving instincts to thrive in fast-moving environments, minimizing blast radius, maximizing reliability. In short: I’m training to be an “expert problem solver”.

## What am I learning?

At the current moment I'm diving into Linux and all the basics related to it with the objective to fully understand it.

## How am I learning?

The roadmap I’m following is inspired by KubeCraft (from Mischa van den Burg). I’m focusing on solid foundations in: Linux, Python, Go, Containers, Git, and Kubernetes… with an extra serving of Kubernetes (and then a bit more Kubernetes).

I’m also building a HomeLab on a laptop to get hands-on with real setups. In my personal [Blog](https://www.oualidbouhorma.com) I’ll share what I’m running, what breaks, and what I add over time.

## Things I've Built
